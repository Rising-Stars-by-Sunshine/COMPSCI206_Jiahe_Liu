### Introduction to the GitHub Repository

This repository covers all assignments of the course: Computational Microeconomics. It explores the frontier research topics in computational microeconomics. The directory CSECON discusses the future of computational economics at the interplay of human, AI, and computational technology. Advanced CSECON analyses the drawbacks of some computational tools for game theory experiments and critiques existing research on federated learning. The directory proposal presents a comparative analysis of gaming behavior of generative AI and reinforcement learning models based on the existing research gap.
