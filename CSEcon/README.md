# Reflection on Milestone 1

### **When computer science meets economics**

I may choose to follow in the footsteps of Herbert Simon and Leslie Lamport. The Nobel Prize winner, Herbert Simon, was the person who laid the foundation for computational models that simulate human behavior in economics. The Turing Award winner, Leslie Lamport, is known for his work on algorithms in distributed computing that support flexible and efficient economic systems, such as blockchain technology.

What I might do is design an algorithm that provides a regulation method that eliminates the horseracing dilemma among individuals in the Bitcoin trading system. To reach an effective algorithm, creating a computational model that predicts how individuals behave in blockchain networks is a must. The model should understand participants in both rational and irrational ways. On one hand, it should include game theory principles to simulate interactions among multiple parties, including miners, users, and developers. It should also incorporate economic analysis to predict the influence of external changes in market conditions, such as fluctuations in the price or changes in the regulatory environment. Moreover, it should include human psychology as one of the factors as well. The ultimate goal is to work out a strategy that effectively addresses the horseracing problem, which would hopefully reduce energy consumption and convert Bitcoin into an eco-friendly trading system.

### **CS & Econ for a Better Future**

I think the combination of computer science and economics, especially in the implementation of blockchain technology, will foster a more secure and effective trading system.

On one hand, blockchain technology enables decentralized networks where transactions and data are recorded in a secure, transparent, and immutable way, as Wu from Conflux mentioned in his talk. The decentralization resulting from blockchain technology reduces reliance on central authorities, thus fostering trust and encouraging individual interactions. This would lead to lower transaction costs, increased market participation, and more efficient resource allocation. On the other hand, blockchain networks have built-in smart contracts that automatically execute agreements without any intermediaries, making business processes streamlined. This would largely reduce transaction costs, thus promoting efficiency.

Learning from all the above, I look forward to more computational technologies being applied in economics for a better tomorrow.

### **Beyond CS & Econ**

When humans are using AI agents for decision-making, transparency might be challenging in evaluating their reliability. Generally speaking, although AI might be more rational than humans, according to Chen et. al (2023), the ability of AI is limited. According to Fan et. al (2023), LLMs fail to catch uncommon preferences and may not accurately apply refined beliefs when taking action. Zhou et. al (2024) expressed similar concerns, stating that LLM cannot grasp market intricacies and has intrinsic bias. AI may also fail to consider human psychology and some other factors when involved in activities. Thus, the adaptation of AI decisions should be under human supervision. However, AI decision-making is not transparent, which makes it challenging for a human to evaluate their results. This requires the AI agents to be frequently tested and evaluated to ensure their stability and efficiency.

AI agents might have inherent strength in dealing with collective optimizing problems. Although most of the time we want AI to work out the best solution under bounded rationality of individual benefit, whether AI focuses on individual or collective interest depends on the demand of humans. According to Horton (2023), AI knows well how humans act based on bounded rationality, and according to Chen (2023) it would do even better, so it has a natural advantage when considering participants as a whole to promote fairness and collective interest because of its computational power.
