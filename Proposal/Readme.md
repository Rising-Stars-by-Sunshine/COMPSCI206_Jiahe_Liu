3. Under the Latex folder, provide the downloaded zip file of your overleaf. 
4. Under the Colab folder, provide the Google Colab using game theory analytical tools to solve for at least the benchmark of your games.
5. The following research description in sections and bullet points in the format of Q&A, envisioning that you are being interviewed at the awarding ceremony of Nobel Prize or Turing Awards for your research. Please apply the rules of formal academic writing.  
o [Summarize the Background/Motivation] 
§ What are the gaps between the existing literature and the pressing social and economic issues in the digital economy of complex system involving 
both human and AI agent that inspires your research? 
o [Research Questions] 
§ What are the questions that your research intends to answer? 
§ Why are the questions important? 
§ Why are the questions not answered by existing game theory literature? 
o [Application Scenario] 
§ In which real-world situation does your newly proposed game and/or solution concept or mechanism apply? 
§ What is the literature in other discipline such as psychology that could provide a behavioral foundation of your newly proposed game and/or solution concept, or mechanism?  
o [Methodology]  
§ What is the key game theoretical or mechanism design framework that you build upon? 
§ What is the key computational or analytical tools that you apply to answer your requestion question? 
§ What is the advanced technology or interdisciplinary insights that you integrate into the existing methods that smartly solve your research question?  
o [Preliminary Results]  
§ Can you provide a concrete illustration example of game theory or mechanism design that your approach significantly improves at least one objective of human welfare compared to existing research without your approach?  
o [Intellectual Merits and Practical impacts of your project.] 
§ Can you demonstrate the limitation of your current research that would inspire future research? For example, what are the other important objectives of human welfare that you approach does not consider yet?  
§ Can you elaborate on how your research can be applied to improve individual, company, and government decisions in strategic scenarios or social choice issues?
