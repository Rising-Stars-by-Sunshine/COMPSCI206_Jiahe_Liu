## Summarize the Background/Motivation

- The gap between existing literature and pressing social and economic issues in the digital economy arises from the complexities of interactions between humans and AI agents. This inspires my research to address how AI decision-making impacts human behavior and vice versa in strategic scenarios.

## Research Questions

*What are the questions that your research intends to answer?*

- How do interactions between human and AI agents in strategic scenarios affect overall system performance and individual welfare?
- What are the behavioral and decision-making dynamics that emerge when humans interact with AI agents in strategic settings?

*Why are the questions important?*

- These questions are essential for understanding the dynamics of human-AI interactions and crucial for designing effective policies, regulations, and algorithms in the digital economy.

*Why are the questions not answered by existing game theory literature?*

- Existing game theory literature often overlooks the nuances introduced by AI agents' involvement and assumes rational, human-only decision-makers, failing to capture the complexities of human-AI interactions.

## Application Scenario

*In which real-world situation does your newly proposed game and/or solution concept or mechanism apply?*

- My proposed research applies to various real-world situations where strategic decision-making is crucial. One example is in the field of economics, where understanding how different agents interact and make decisions can inform policy interventions aimed at improving market efficiency, resource allocation, and overall economic welfare. Additionally, this research can be applied in negotiation settings, conflict resolution processes, and strategic planning in business, politics, and international relations, where insights into human and AI decision-making dynamics are essential for achieving desirable outcomes.

*What is the literature in another discipline such as psychology that could provide a behavioral foundation for your newly proposed game and/or solution concept, or mechanism?*

- The literature in psychology provides a behavioral foundation for understanding human responses to AI agents. Studies on human-computer interaction, trust in automation, and decision-making in uncertain environments offer valuable insights into how individuals perceive and interact with AI agents. For instance, research by Nass and Reeves (1996) on the media equation theory suggests that individuals tend to apply social rules and expectations to interactions with computers and AI agents, shaping their trust and reliance on these systems. Additionally, work by Acquisti and Grossklags (2005) highlights the role of privacy concerns and perceived control in users' acceptance of AI-driven recommendations and decisions, further informing our understanding of human-AI interactions in online environments.

## Methodology

*What is the key game theoretical or mechanism design framework that you build upon?*

- My research builds upon key game theoretical frameworks, such as repeated games, signaling games, and mechanism design.

*What are the key computational or analytical tools that you apply to answer your research question?*

- I employ computational and analytical tools, including reinforcement learning algorithms, agent-based simulations, and economic experiments, to explore human-AI interactions and their implications.

*What is the advanced technology or interdisciplinary insights that you integrate into the existing methods that smartly solve your research question?*

- By integrating advanced technology and interdisciplinary insights, my approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexities, providing practical solutions to complex strategic problems.

## Preliminary Results

*Can you provide a concrete illustration example of game theory or mechanism design that your approach significantly improves at least one objective of human welfare compared to existing research without your approach?*

- In the context of the Centipede Game, my research compares the performance of generative AI and reinforcement learning models in predicting player behavior. By analyzing simulated game scenarios, we found that the generative AI model outperforms reinforcement learning in capturing complex strategic interactions and predicting decision-making processes. This improvement leads to a deeper understanding of player behavior and more accurate predictions of game outcomes, thereby enhancing decision-making in strategic settings.

## Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts of Your Project

*Can you demonstrate the limitations of your current research that would inspire future research?*

- My research may not fully capture the ethical considerations and social implications of AI adoption in strategic settings, and it may not address all objectives of human welfare, such as equity and sustainability.

*Can you elaborate on how your research can be applied to improve individual, company, and government decisions in strategic scenarios or social choice issues?*

- By providing policymakers, businesses, and individuals with a deeper understanding of human-AI interactions, my research enables more informed decision-making and the development of policies and systems that promote fairness, efficiency, and societal welfare in the digital economy.
